If you like Tigre purpose and would like to contribute this page can help you.

Tigre supports only python 3.7+ and you need version 3.7+ to develop. We recommend that you use `Pyenv` to manage many Python environments. Basic instructions can be found below.

For development we recommend `Poetry` and configuration can be found below too.

To manipulate remote webdrivers, we have a `docker_test_image` on this repository, but we recommend `Selenoid` containers. They are more stable.
