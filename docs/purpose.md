# Purpose and motivation
Tigre was born to ease the confusing calls of selenium webdriver.

If you have problems with different APIs for calling remote, local or mobile browsers, or if you are confused by so many different capabilities settings or have trouble with hard-to-maintain code, Tigre was designed especially for you.
